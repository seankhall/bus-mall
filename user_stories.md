Bus Mall User Story

I have 20 products and I want to find out which one is the most popular from random people.
I want three of products to appear at random on the web page, to include on a refreshing of the page, and they will be displayed inline to one another.
Each product will have a text on it of what the item is.
The individual will go through a process, with a max of 25 times, choosing which product they like the most out of the three currently being displayed.
They will choose by simply clicking on the item; once clicked multiple things must happen.
    1. Each vote will be tracked.
    2. Each product will be tracked for how many times it was selected.
    3. Three new products will be displayed.
    4. Repeats are allowed BUT not right after the other.
Once the 25 cycles have been completed I want each product to be displayed in text on the web page showing the user how many times each product was voted on.
